<p>You can trace the origin of the term &#8220;bunny&#8221; back to the historical use of &#8220;bun&#8221; as a simple and even cute way of referring to a rabbit. Over time, this endearing nickname became widely adopted, especially when referring to a young rabbit or a small or baby rabbit.</p>



<p>Despite the informal nature of &#8220;bunny,&#8221; both terms accurately describe the same animal. (This means that, yes, a person can just as easily call the Easter bunny the Easter rabbit!) Some people might even use both terms at once, declaring the animal a &#8220;bunny rabbit&#8221; or a &#8220;rabbit bunny.&#8221;</p>



<p>While the word &#8220;rabbit&#8221; is the more scientifically recognized term, &#8220;bunny&#8221; can convey a sense of endearment for the playful and cute qualities of baby rabbits. If you&#8217;re struggling to decide between &#8220;rabbit&#8221; or &#8220;bunny,&#8221; just know that it&#8217;s really up to your personal preference and the context.</p>



<p>The word &#8220;rabbit&#8221; may be more appropriate for formal settings; however, in everyday language and popular culture, people continue to use &#8220;bunny&#8221; to convey a sense of affection for these lovable creatures.</p>
